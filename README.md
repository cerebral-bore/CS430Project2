# CS430Project2
In this project you will write code to raycast mathematical primitives based on a scene input file
into a pixel buffer. You will then write the pixel buffer to a PPM formatted file using the code
you wrote in Project 1 (P3 or P6 format).

Your program should be resistant to errors and should not segfault or produce undefined
behavior. If an error occurs, it should print a message to stderr with “Error:” prefixed to a
descriptive error message before returning a non-zero error code.
